While creating L1 tests on IDs = PKs uniquenes and nulls performed (noted at queries)

Customers = contracts.

Be careful when reporting on measure units, they should only be compared against each other, if normalization has not been performed, it would not make sense.

BUSINESS QUESTIONS:
Which customers leave and when?
Do they buy little/a lot?
Are there still products they bought?

L3 created in order to answer the questions above.
See attached ERP diagram.
